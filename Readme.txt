This program takes some midi in and outputs keyboard commands. I made this for a very specific project where we had a custom device generating MIDI and wanted to play video games off it. 

The code has some Mido work in it and I feel pretty comfortable with that library now a days so if you have any questions let me know. Also the code is super sloppy and I really only intended it for my own use so let me know if you any questions on that.

Also Joe told me to make this Readme so you can thank him for that.
